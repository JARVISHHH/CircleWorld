Interviewee 1: Xinqian Zhou
	- Advice 1: Can add some interesting traps or harder levels.
	- Advice 2: Can give the character multiple lives.
	- Advice 3: Can add some saving points. Once the character died, it will be transfered to the saving point and restart the current level.


Interviewee 2: Yaxin Liu
	- Advice 1: It's hard to recognise the direction the character is shooting.
	- Advice 2: May consider changing buttons players use to jump and shoot. It's a little weird to use Shift for jumping.
