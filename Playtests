Interviewee 1: Xinqian Zhou
	- Advice 1: Can add some interesting traps or harder levels.
	- Advice 2: Can give the character multiple lives.

Interviewee 2: Yaxin Liu
	- Advice 1: It's hard to recognise the direction the character is shooting.
	- Advice 2: May consider changing keys players use to jump and shoot. It's a little weird to use Shift for jumping.
